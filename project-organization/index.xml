      <description>PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s release and support cycle The PrestaShop project follows the Semantic Versioning convention and alternates between major and minor releases.
Major versions Major versions (eg. 8.0.0, 9.0.0) are important milestones. These versions contain new features, bug fixes, and above all, backward-incompatible changes that can impact modules and themes.
 Release cycle: every 12–18 months. Support: bug fixes until the next minor release.  Example: v8.0 receives bug fixes until v8.1 is released.</description>

      <description>How we work The project&amp;rsquo;s leadership is organized around project councils: self-organized, lightweight groups whose mission is to facilitate decision-making. Each council has authority over a defined domain.
 Technical Council – decides on technical subjects, including architecture and implementation choices. Product Council – decides on product management subjects, including what features belong in the project, specifications, UI/UX guidelines, and wordings. Quality Council – decides on quality assurance subjects, including quality processes, verification of pull requests, and bug triage.</description>
