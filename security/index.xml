      <description>Security Policy Obviously, PrestaShop project security is a critical matter. Project members are dedicated to keeping a high level of security in every aspect of the software.
However a software without vulnerability does not exist, which is why there is a security report process. If you find a security issue, please follow it to responsibly disclose your findings.
Reporting a Vulnerability Security issues can be reported by sending an email to security-core@prestashop.</description>
