      <description>How issues are sorted What happens to the issue you have reported The PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA) uses a transparent definition for the criteria used to qualify issues&#39; severity and how they should be applied through labels on GitHub issues.
Please note that the severity is to be distinguished from the priority. Indeed, severity is used to measure the negative impact that a bug has on a system, a feature, a component or on the project development.</description>
