      <description>Preliminary tasks Before you can start your build, you must make sure that the project is ready to be built.
1. Communicate Starting this step means that the Development phase of this release is over (freeze step):
Verify that the release milestone on github is 100% complete. If there are still PRs remaining, create the milestone for an another release and tag the remaining PRs to it.
Inform the @prestashop/committers about the release tracking issue.</description>

      <description>Security patch releases Context In the past, we used to mix security fixes for major security issues and regular Pull Requests, but that made releasing new versions of PrestaShop harder. Today when there is a major security vulnerability reported, we fix it in a scoped security patch release which contains only the security fixes.
Examples: PrestaShop 8.1.6 or PrestaShop 8.1.4
For regular patch releases, we start from the content of the patch branch to create a new build.</description>

      <description>Create a new branch for a new major/minor version. 1. Create the new branch and push it to the main repo Create the branch on you local git and push it to the main repository. You will need to push it to the main repository and not to your fork.
2. Open PRs based on the new branch and modify those files: To create the new branch, we need to update several repositories to complete the necessary work.</description>

      <description>Create a build package Once preliminary tasks have been completed, the project is ready to be built.
1. Merge any not yet merged security fixes into your branch To avoid disclosing security issues before the version is released, security Pull Request are merged in GitHub after the build has been validated. In order to include them in your build, you need to retrieve them manually and merge them in your local branch.</description>

      <description>Release the version publicly Once the QA team has greenlighted your build, you can move forward with the public release.
Make certain you have go for publish! Also, avoid starting this process after 4 PM or on a Friday. 1. Merge security PRs on GitHub If there are unmerged security PRs:
 Merge them on GitHub and publishing their security advisories. Rebase the build branch that you created on the previous step to remove the merge commits from the security PRs you merged manually before.</description>
