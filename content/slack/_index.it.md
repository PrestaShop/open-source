## Ground rules & good practices

- Communicate respectfully and constructively. The project's [Code of Conduct]({{< relref "/code-of-conduct" >}}) applies to Slack as well. Disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
- English is the project's official working language. When discussing in public channels, please use English only.
- Help people know who you are by filling out your Slack user profile. Consider adding your real name, your company, and of course, your GitHub account if you have one.
- If you need help, see [Get help with PrestaShop]({{< relref "/support" >}}).
- If you find a bug in the project, don't forget to [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose).
- If you find the solution to your question, consider [improving the docs](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs).

{{% notice tip %}}
**Tip:** If you feel that someone is being aggressive, consider the possibility that English might not be their native language, and thus they might be having a hard time expressing themselves effectively. Keep a cool head and assume good intentions until proven otherwise.
