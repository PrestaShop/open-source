# How to become a committer

In the PrestaShop project, committers are contributors with merge rights.

Committers participate in reviewing code contributions.

## Prerequisites to become a committer

1. **Active participation in the project**
    - Have at least one accepted, quality Pull Request.
    - Display a record of Pull Request reviews.
    - Real interest in getting involved in code review.
2. **Cultural convergence**
    - Respect the Code of Conduct; behave respectfully and in good faith.
    - Agree to work together with the rest of the maintainer team towards main goals (see [The Future Architecture][future-architecture]): migration to Symfony, adoption of VueJS ...

## Requirements to continue being a committer

All the above, plus:

1. **Continuous participation and involvement**
    - Actively and responsibly review Pull Requests.
2. **Responsible behavior**
    - Respect & enforce the project’s quality standards and contribution guidelines.
    - Respect & enforce the project’s issue and code review workflow.
    - Respect & enforce convergence with the project’s goals.
    - Put the best interest of the project before one’s own (in case of conflict of interests).

## How to apply to be a committer

1. [Open an issue on the open source repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/new) explaining why you apply to become a committer, and on what part of the project (Core or module/subproject).
2. If three maintainers approve the application, the new committer is approved.
3. After 30 days, if the issue did not receive three positive votes, it is considered rejected and closed.

Note: the above process is not mandatory for individuals who are offered the committer role by maintainers, as long as the candidate is supported by at least three maintainers.

Upon approval, new committer is granted full committer rights and accesses for a 90-day trial period. This period aims to provide both the maintainer team and the new committer a better understanding of this new arrival and to validate whether expectations meet reality. Both maintainer team or new committer can express their wish for this situation to end before the 90-day trial period, revoking the committer status.

At the end of the 90-day trial period, the committer is confirmed in his position.

## How to lose the committer status

A project committer status can be revoked for any of the following reasons:

- Refusal to follow the rules and policies stated in this document.
- Lack of activity for the past three months.
- Willful negligence or intent to harm the PrestaShop project.
- On their demand, for personal reasons.
- On request of at least three maintainers.
