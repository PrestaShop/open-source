# How to release a new PrestaShop version

This section describes the release process, step by step. A PrestaShop version release requires all these steps to be completed.

## Prerequisites

To perform a build, you will need the following:

- [Git][git-scm], so you can clone [the project's Git repository][github-repository] on your computer.
- The [PHP CLI][php] executable (within the [compatible version range][compatible-php-versions] of the PrestaShop version you will be building), so you can create a build.
- The [Composer][get-composer] executable, to fetch PHP dependencies.
- The [NodeJs CLI][nodejs] executable (within the [compatible version range][nodejs-requirements]) and NPM, to compile assets.

Some of steps will require special tools or access rights which are currently not accessible for maintainers outside the PrestaShop Company. A notice indicates when this is the case.
