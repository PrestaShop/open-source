# License & license compatibility

In order to protect PrestaShop users from patent trolls, it's important to make sure that all content included and distributed with PrestaShop is covered under homogeneous license terms.

The **PrestaShop Core** software is released under the [OSL 3.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0). Therefore, all original work included in PrestaShop itself must be released under that license as well.

PrestaShop's [Native Modules][native-modules] and the **Classic theme** are released under the [AFL 3.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0). Similarly, this license applies to all original work contributed to these projects.

## Third party content

Third party content may be included in PrestaShop as long as its original authors have released it under a [compatible license][compatible-licenses]. If the proposed content is available with a compliant license, a last check must be done to make sure that there is no additional clause that would introduce a restriction of use.
