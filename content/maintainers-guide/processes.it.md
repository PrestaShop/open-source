# Processi

## Security recommendations

Maintainer GitHub accounts are granted extended rights on the PrestaShop organization.

We require from maintainers to take the necessary steps to make sure this account is protected. This means, but not only:
- enable 2FA on GitHub
- use a safe and strong password
- be very careful about GitHub tokens granting account accesses
