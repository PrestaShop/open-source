# Project organization

## Project roles

Product Managers provide the product vision for the project, ensuring that the software meets the needs of its various users.

Current product managers:

- Fabien Vallon ([@fabienvallon](https://github.com/fabienvallon))
- Mateus Shirlaw ([@MatShir](https://github.com/MatShir))

### Project Maintainers

Project maintainers provide the technical vision for the whole project, reviewing and merging code contributions, while ensuring that the software is developed according to the product vision.

Current maintainers:

- Ibrahima Sow ([@sowbiba](https://github.com/sowbiba))

#### Scoped Maintainers

Scoped Maintainers have the same mission as Project Maintainers, but over a limited scope (e.g. a project, a repository, or a technology).

If the scope is one or multiple repositories, maintainers rights are granted only on these repositories.
If the scope is larger (example: being in charge of a folder inside a repository) maintainer rights are granted on the repository and the scoped maintainer is trusted not to abuse.

- Daniel Hlavacek ([@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox)) is a scoped maintainer for [Classic](https://github.com/prestashop/classic-theme) and [Hummingbird](https://github.com/prestashop/hummingbird) themes

### Committers

Committers participate in reviewing code contributions and are able to include them in the project once they have been accepted and verified.

Current committers: No one yet.

### UX Designers

UX Designers make sure that interfaces follow the best practices in usability and design.

Current UX designers:

- Tristan Lehot ([@TristanLDD](https://github.com/TristanLDD))

### Issue Managers
