# How to download PrestaShop

PrestaShop can be downloaded in two ways, depending on your needs.

## Installer package (recommended)

The easiest way to get PrestaShop is to download the installer package from [prestashop.com/versions](https://www.prestashop.com/versions).

This package is ready to install and includes the PrestaShop core along with a selection of commercial modules provided by PrestaShop SA. It is the recommended option for most merchants and agencies setting up a new store.

> **Note:** The installer package integrates commercial products by PrestaShop SA. These are optional, but are bundled in the download for convenience.

## Source archive (GitHub)

If you want to build your own distribution or need full control over what is included, you can download the source archive directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases).

This archive contains only the open-source core of PrestaShop, without any commercial additions. It is intended for developers and integrators who want to assemble and package their own distribution.

For guidance on how to build a distribution from the sources, refer to the [distribution documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/basics/deployment/distribution/).
