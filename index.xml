      <description>PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s release and support cycle The PrestaShop project follows the Semantic Versioning convention and alternates between major and minor releases.
Major versions Major versions (eg. 8.0.0, 9.0.0) are important milestones. These versions contain new features, bug fixes, and above all, backward-incompatible changes that can impact modules and themes.
 Release cycle: every 12–18 months. Support: bug fixes until the next minor release.  Example: v8.0 receives bug fixes until v8.1 is released.</description>

      <description>How to become a maintainer In the PrestaShop project, maintainers are contributors with merge rights.
The maintainer status is a position of great power, but it also carries great responsibility. As gatekeepers to the project&amp;rsquo;s code, maintainers are ultimately responsible for every contribution that is included in the project.
Candidates can apply to become maintainer over the whole project, or just a scope (a project, a repository, or a technology).</description>

      <description>Preliminary tasks Before you can start your build, you must make sure that the project is ready to be built.
1. Create the new version in Addons Marketplace and update native module compatibility This step requires special rights.
Ask a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with administrative rights on the Addons Marketplace to perform this step.
 This only needs to be done once per release.
(i.e. if done for a beta, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be performed again for the final release).</description>

Make certain you have go for publish! Also, avoid starting this process after 4 PM or on a Friday. 1. Merge security PRs on GitHub If there are unmerged security PRs:
 Merge them on GitHub and publishing their security advisories. Rebase the build branch that you created on the previous step to remove the merge commits from the security PRs you merged manually before.</description>

These feedback are grouped together to create &amp;ldquo;features ideas&amp;rdquo; that you can see at http://feedback.prestashop.com/. The Productboard app connects this Slack to the PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s Productboard.
It allows the product managers to transform a Slack message (and its comments) into a feedback &amp;ldquo;note&amp;rdquo; on productboard.</description>

The Issue Manager job Your job is to qualify issues submitted to the GitHub project. Good issues help us discover bugs and provide ideas to improve PrestaShop and the native modules. These are the three questions you must ask yourself:
 Is the issue valid? The issue must be either a bug report or a feature request.</description>
